# Spinner Control Case

All parts were printed with a 0.4 mm nozzle. All holes were sized for threaded inserts for M3 and M2.5 screws. STEP files are provided if you need to make adjustments.

I've included a fit test for the microswitch slots that can be printed before printing the full microswitch carrier. You want the switch to fit snugly, but bear in mind that if it the fit is really tight then it's going to force the sides of the slot outward making the adjacent slots even tighter.
